## Simulation Response

Honestly, I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed after going through all 14 parts of this documentation. Let me be real about what I understood and what confused me:

**What I think I got:**
- This is some kind of SDK for working with APIs
- There's authentication involved with tokens
- You need to set up credentials somehow
- There are examples showing how to make API calls

**What's confusing me:**
- I'm completely lost on what "bearer tokens" actually are and why I need them
- The authentication flow seems really complicated - why can't I just use a username and password directly?
- What's the difference between all these authentication methods? When do I use which one?
- The code examples jump around a lot and I can't follow the complete flow from start to finish

**My biggest frustrations:**
- There's no simple "Hello World" example that shows me how to make ONE basic API call from scratch
- I don't understand what I need to install or set up first
- The examples assume I know what things like "refresh intervals" and "token expiration" mean
- There's a lot of Java-specific stuff that I'm not familiar with yet

**What I really need:**
- A step-by-step tutorial that starts with "First, install this..." 
- One complete, simple example that I can copy and paste to see something work
- Explanations of WHY I need tokens instead of just HOW to use them
- Maybe some diagrams showing how the authentication flow works?

I see there's a note about "TODO: document tools available for testing the SDK" - that would actually be super helpful! I'd love to know how to test if I'm doing things right.

Can someone point me to a beginner-friendly getting started guide? This feels like it's written for people who already know a lot about APIs and authentication.
